# BigRock Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Index of /" Page Shows Instead of Website

**Problem**: Directory listing instead of website
**Solution**: 
- Check if `index.html` is in `public_html` folder
- Verify file permissions (should be 644)
- Make sure `.htaccess` is uploaded

### 2. Website Not Loading

**Check These:**
1. **File Location**: 
   - Files must be in `public_html` folder
   - Not in subfolders

2. **File Names**:

   - Must be exactly `.htaccess` (not `.htaccess.txt`)

3. **File Permissions**:
   - `index.html`: 644
   - `.htaccess`: 644

**Solution**:
